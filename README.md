# SQL-Analysis---Golden-Age-of-Video-Games

In this project, I analysed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. The purpose was to find a video game golden age by finding release years that fans and critics preferred, as well as to delve into the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data. The search involved joining datasets, comparing results with set theory, filtering, grouping, and ordering data using SQL.
